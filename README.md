# ðŸŒº About Buzzlet â€“ Our Data Quality Hummingbird!

Buzzlet is the **pet hummingbird of House REDCap**, introduced as part of our *gamification strategy* to make data quality improvement more engaging and fun.

## Her only job? **Munching on blooms** ðŸŒ¸

And we help her do that by making our data great! Every time we complete a data review, Buzzlet gets closer to her bloom. When all reviews for a patient are done, she finally gets to enjoy it!
